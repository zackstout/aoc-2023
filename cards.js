/**
 * If your hand contains 9 cards, and opponent gets to see 3 of them, what are chances of their seeing a particular card?
 *
 * Well.... There are 9 choose 3 = 84 total possibilities.... how many include that card?
 *
 * I guess it would appear in all sets that included it along with some other pair...
 *
 * How many pairs thare there? That should be 9 choose 2 ... 36. Oh wait!! 8 choose 2. Only 28.
 *
 * So it's a 28 / 84 chance of getting a particular card.... roughly a third.... sounds about right.
